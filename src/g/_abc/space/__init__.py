"""Abstract Space base classes.

In this Art of Geometry package, Spaces are set-like geometric entities
containing Points and in/on which Points can be moved/transformed.

This Art of Geometry package primarily deals with SMOOTHLY CONTINUOUS Spaces,
in/on which Points' movements/transformations are characterized by smoothly/
differentiably continuous functions and/or coordinate/parametric equations.

The 3-dimensional Euclidean space, 2-dimensional Euclidean flat planes,
2-dimensional spherical/elliptical/hyperbolical surfaces, 1-dimensional
Euclidean straight lines, 1-dimensional circles and conic curves are all
considered Spaces. A Space hence naturally contains lower-dimensional Spaces.

Spaces do not have "hard" boundaries that "prevent" Points from moving across.
For example, half-planes or hemispheres are not considered Spaces.
